# Introduction
I'm a relatively recent graduate of the Biostatistics program at University of Zurich.
Over the course of my studies, I've picked up coding in C, C++, Fortran, Python, and R
to varying degrees of proficiency. I'm mainly familiar with R.

Albeit it's still a work in progress, this repository will contain some of the code I 
wrote during my studies, and more importantly the main branch for the R package which
I submitted to CRAN.
